# `django-exceptional`

`django-exceptional` is a Django client for [Exceptional][], a service which
tracks errors in your web apps.

  [exceptional]: http://getexceptional.com/


## Usage

Install the app:

    pip install django-exceptional

Add the middleware to your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES:

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        ...
        'djexceptional.ExceptionalMiddleware',
        ...
    )

Set up your Exceptional API keys in `settings.py`:

    EXCEPTIONAL_API_KEY = '...'

Done! Remember, the middleware will only log exceptions when `DEBUG` is off.

IF you want to send an exception manually after catching it yourself, you can do so with:

    e = Exceptional()
    e.send(exception)
